### TwitchDownloader
A Twitch VOD/Clip/Chat downloader I wrote, as well as a chat render feature

## What can this do?
- Can download Twitch VODs
- Can download Twitch Clips
- Can download chat for VODS and Clips, in either a [JSON with all the information](https://pastebin.com/raw/YDgRe6X4) or a [simple text file](https://pastebin.com/raw/016azeQX)
- Can use a previously generated JSON chat file, to [render the chat](https://youtu.be/tASh2llVpN0) with FFZ and BTTV support (including GIFS)

## Why does it look so ugly?
Because I made this in 2 days and I wanted to put it up before school starts :( (tomorrow as of publishing this)

## Things still needed to be done
- Proper error handling (Just crashes most of the time currently)
- Proper input validation
- Have the text log actually log stuff
- Better emoji support for chat rendering
- More options for chat rendering
- Make it look less ugly
