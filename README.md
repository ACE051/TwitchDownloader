### TwitchDownloader
A Twitch VOD/Clip/Chat downloader I wrote, as well as a chat render feature

## Video Demonstration (older version, same concept)

## What can this do?
- Can download Twitch VODs
- Can download Twitch Clips
- Can download chat for VODS and Clips, in either a [JSON with all the information](https://pastebin.com/raw/YDgRe6X4) or a [simple text file](https://pastebin.com/raw/016azeQX)
- Can use a previously generated JSON chat file, to render the chat with FFZ and BTTV support (including GIFS)

## Things still needed to be done
- Fix bugs that slipped by
- More options for chat rendering
